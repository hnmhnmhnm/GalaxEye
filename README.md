# GalaxEye
This is a full-stack geospatial web application project where the goal is to let users upload two GeoTIFF images, preview them side-by-side, define an Area of Interest (AOI), and process the images (clip + align) via a Python worker. The architecture involves React (frontend), Node.js (backend API/orchestration), Python, and Docker.
